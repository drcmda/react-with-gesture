        <code>touch-action: none</code> is a common css property that you'll set on draggable items so that scroll
        doesn't interfere with the drag behavior on touch devices. However, this generally means that the scroll of the
        page can't be initiated from the draggable element. This is fine if your page isn't meant to be scrolled or if
        your draggable element is relatively small, but in case of large draggable areas this might become a usability
        issue.

        <code>preventScroll</code> is a convenient way to have both vertical drag and vertical scrolling coexist. Note
        that scroll will always have precedence over drag. To drag vertically the user will have to press and hold the
        draggable area for <code>250ms</code> (or the specified duration) without moving. After this duration, the element
        is draggable and scrolling is prevented. Note that if you drag horizontally the scroll will immediately be prevented
        without waiting for this duration.

        On desktop, you should be able to drag the torus as you would expect without delay. On mobile, initiating scroll 
        from the torus should let you scroll the page as expected. Hold down on the torus and you should be able to drag 
        it after <code>250ms</code>. This might be clunky as it's still under testing.
